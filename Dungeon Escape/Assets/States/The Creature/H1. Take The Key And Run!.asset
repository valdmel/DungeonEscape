  storyText: 'I have run towards the only door left in the last room I was in before.
    I have inserted the key in the lock and open the door rapidly. I have locked
    the door behind me so the creature won''t follow me again... Hopefully.

    My
    heart is beating fast and I''m trying to stop shaking in fear. I can still hear
    the creature growling in pain due to the injury.

    There is a small wooden
    table and chair to my right and a window to my left.


    What should I do?


    1.
    Sit down on the chair.

    2. Look through the window.'
