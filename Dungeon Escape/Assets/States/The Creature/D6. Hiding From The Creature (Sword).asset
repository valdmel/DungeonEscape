  storyText: 'I quickly close the door and hide myself within the dead bodies laying
    on the floor. God... The stench is out of this world... How long have some of
    these bodies been in here? Are these all prisioners?

    Suddenly, the creature
    enters the room. However, it doesn''t seem to be seeking after me. By the way
    it walks, I can tell it is really tall and heavy, but nothing more than that.
    I see that it has approched the pile of bodies and took one to cut on the table
    right next to the furnace... I must get out of here as quickly as I can!


    What
    should I do?


    1. Get off the pile of dead bodies.'
