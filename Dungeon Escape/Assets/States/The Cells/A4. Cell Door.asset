  storyText: "I see a large corridor through the cell. Burning torches can be heard
    and I notice a few other cell doors, but no sign of guards or other prisioners...
    This place is creepy as hell. Why did they throw me in here? \nLooking at the
    keyhole, I can tell its old and kinda rusty.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n1. Try to
    open the door.\n2. Step back and move towards the window."
