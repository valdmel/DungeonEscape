  storyText: 'There doesn''t seem to be a living soul in this floor too. I can still
    hear these strange growls coming from somewhere in this place as I follow this
    blood trail down the corridor...

    As I walk, I found myself in a mid-sized
    room with a door to my right and to my left. The blood trail goes into the room
    behind the door on the right, and is possible to hear a furnace-like sound.


    What
    should I do?


    1. Open the right door.

    2. Open the left door.'
