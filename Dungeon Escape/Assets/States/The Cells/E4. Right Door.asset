  storyText: 'As the door finally opens, I can''t believe what I''m staring at...
    Bodies. Dead human bodies are laying on the floor. Some are dismembered and part
    of their flesh have been eaten off. Right in front of me there is this big furnace,
    probably used to cook these poor souls... The stench of rotten flesh mixed with
    burning coal has plagued entire room.

    "What in God''s name is happening
    in here?!" - I say loudly. Suddenly, loud footsteps can be heard coming from
    the corridor I was in before, followed by that strange growl I have been hearing
    all this time. I''m not alone in this place!!!


    What should I do?


    1.
    Hide within the dead bodies.'
