    It is windy and the sky is completely clear... It is possible to see full moon
    stands right above me. River sounds can be heard from my left as well as owls
    hooting from a forest north from where I am.

    Given my view, I can''t really
    tell in which floor I am. What have I done to deserve such punishment?


    What
    should I do?


    1. Move towards the cell door.

    2. Try to break the bars.'
