  storyText: 'I kick the lever with all my might just to hear the sound of the gate
    coming down. The creature gets closer more and more, roaring in fury. I don''t
    know what to do, so I stay unmoved in despair. I close my eyes, waiting for a
    certain and hopefully quick and painless death...

    All of sudden, I hear
    the sound of metal hitting the ground, and a pain scream echoed the place. I
    open my eyes and, in front me, lays the creature completely crushed. It is finally
    dead...


    What should I do?


    1. Leave the dungeon.'
