  storyText: "I push the lever and can hear some kind of mechanism operating. Looks
    like a gate opening! \r I have left the room through the only entrance available
    and stepped into a large hall-like room.\r\nThere are six huge columns in this
    place - some of which are cracked - and bones can be seen everywhere. The place
    is a completely mess...\r\nRight there, in front of me, lays the gate! It is
    completely opened!\r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\r\n\r\n1. Walk towards the gate."
