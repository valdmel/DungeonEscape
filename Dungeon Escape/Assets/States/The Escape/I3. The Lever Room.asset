  storyText: 'I found myself in a small room with some old wine casks on it. There
    is a large dried puddle of wine spilled on the ground, and three cockroaches
    walking on the table to my right. To my left, there is this big wooden lever
    and an entrance right next to it.

    The lever seems to be connected to some
    sort of mechanism...


    What should I do?


    1. Pull the lever.'
