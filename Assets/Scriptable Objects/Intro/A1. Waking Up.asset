  dialogue: 'I wake up in the middle of a dark cell and I can''t remember what happened.
    My weapons are gone and I feel a cold breeze going down my spine. I look around
    and see some dirty rags on the ground covered with what seems to be dried blood
    and a small metal bucket with a strange liquid in it. To my left, there are a
    few cockroaches eating a rotten piece of bread left on a small plate. To my right,
    a brick mossy wall with a few cracks on it. At my back, it is possible to see
    a small cell window that projects a few rays of light over the cold and dark
    ground. It is a full moon night. Right in front of me lays a cell door with a
    small keyhole on it. From outside it, I can hear some rats squeaking from a distance
    and dripping water from the ceiling. I am are completely alone as there doesn''t
    seem to be anyone guarding the cell.





    What should I do?



    1. Get
    up and move towards the cell door.

    2. Get up and look through the cell window.'
