  dialogue: 'A2. Cell Window

    I look through the window just to notice how beautiful
    the night is. It is windy and the sky is completely clear... It is possible to
    see full moon stands right above me. River sounds can be heard from my left as
    well as owls hooting from a forest north from where I am.

    

    Given
    my view, I can''t really tell in which floor I am. What have I done to deserve
    such punishment?

    

    

    

    What should I do?

    

    1.
    Move towards the cell door.

    2. Try to break the bars.'
