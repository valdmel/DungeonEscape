  storyText: 'I have found myself in a more lighten floor of the dungeon, so my torch
    won''t be of any use anymore. A strange noise of what seems to be a growl can
    be heard from somehwere...

    There is a closed door to my right and another
    corridor in front of me. There are blood marks on the wall and a trail on the
    ground... Seems very fresh.


    What should I do?


    1. Try to open the
    door.

    2. Follow the blood.'
