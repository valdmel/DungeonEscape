  dialogue: 'A piece of rotten bread partly eaten lays down on the ground. A feast
    for the cockroaches.


    "I''m not putting my lips on that." - you think.


    Right
    in front of you, a few cockroaches can be seen around the rotten piece of bread.
    Nothing special.

    To your left, you see an old bed with a straw mat on it
    and right beside it, a small metal bucket filled with a stenchful liquid.

    Right
    behind you, there are some dirty rags on the floor covered with what seems to
    be dried blood.

    To your right, lays a cell door partially rusted.


    What
    do you want to do?


    W. Can''t move forward

    A. Move Left

    S. Move
    South

    D. Move Right'
