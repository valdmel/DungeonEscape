  dialogue: 'You see bloodstains and rags scattered all around the floor. "Was it...
    From the last prisoner...?" - you wonder.


    Right in front of you, dirty
    bloodied rags scattered on the floor. Yuck.

    To your left, lays a cell door
    partially rusted.

    Right behind you, you see a few cockroaches eating a rotten
    piece of bread on a small plate.

    To your right, you see an old bed with
    a straw mat on it and right beside it, a small metal bucket filled with a stenchful
    liquid.


    What do you want to do?


    W. Can''t move forward

    A. Move
    Left

    S. Move South

    D. Move Right'
