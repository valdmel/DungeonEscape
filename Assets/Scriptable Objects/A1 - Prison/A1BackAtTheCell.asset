  dialogue: 'You found yourself back at the cell you just woke up in. Home sweet
    home.


    Right in front of you, you see an old bed with a straw mat on it
    and right beside it, a small metal bucket filled with a stenchful liquid.

    To
    your left, there are some dirty rags on the floor covered with what seems to
    be dried blood.

    Right behind you, lays a cell door partially rusted.

    To
    your right, you see a few cockroaches eating a rotten piece of bread on a small
    plate.


    What do you want to do?


    W. Move North

    A. Move Left
