  dialogue: 'You found yourself back at the cell you just woke up in.


    Right
    in front of you, lays a cell door partially rusted.

    To your left, you see
    a few cockroaches eating a rotten piece of bread on a small plate.

    Right
    behind you, you see an old bed with a straw mat on it and right beside it, a
    small metal bucket filled with a stenchful liquid.

    To your right, there
    are some dirty rags on the floor covered with what seems to be dried blood.


    What
    do you want to do?


    W. Move North

    A. Move Left
