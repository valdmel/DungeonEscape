  dialogue: 'You wake up in the middle of an old and dark cell, and can''t remember
    what happened. Rats squeaking and dripping water can be heard from somewhere
    around the floor. You get up and take a better around.


    Right in front of
    you, lays a cell door partially rusted.

    To your left, you see a few cockroaches
    eating a rotten piece of bread on a small plate.

    Right behind you, you see
    an old bed with a straw mat on it and right beside it, a small metal bucket filled
    with a stenchful liquid.

    To your right, there are some dirty rags on the
    floor covered with what seems to be dried blood.


    A cold breeze runs down
    your spine: you realize you''re in a dungeon, alone and completely defenseless.
    Every step you take will influence your progress within the game, so pay attention
    and think before making any move. If you die, you die. No continues. Use WASD
    to move around.


    Good luck!
