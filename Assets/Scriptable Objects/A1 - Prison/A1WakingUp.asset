  dialogue: 'You wake up in the middle of an old and dark cell, and can''t remember
    what happened. Rats squeaking and dripping water can be heard from somewhere
    around the floor. You get up and take a better around.


    To your left, you
    see a few cockroaches eating a rotten piece of bread on a small plate.

    To
    your right, there are some dirty rags on the floor covered with what seems to
    be dried blood.

    Right behind you, you see an old bed with a straw mat on
    it and right beside it, a small metal bucket filled with a stenchful liquid.

    Right
    in front of you there is a cell door with a small keyhole on it.


    A cold
    breeze runs down your spine: you realize you''re in a dungeon, alone and completely
    defenseless. Every step you take will influence your progress within the game,
    so pay attention and think before making any move. If you die, you die. No continues.
    Use WASD to move around.


    Good luck!
