  storyText: 'I wake up in the middle of a dark cell and I can''t remember what happened.
    My weapons are gone and I feel a cold breeze going down my spine. I look around
    and see some dirty rags on the ground covered with what seems to be dried blood
    and a small metal bucket with a strange liquid in it.

    To my left, there
    are a few cockroaches eating a rotten piece of bread left on a small plate. To
    my right, a brick mossy wall with a few cracks on it. At my back, it is possible
    to see a small cell window that projects a few rays of light over the cold and
    dark ground. It is a full moon night. Right in front of me lays a cell door with
    a small keyhole on it. From outside it, I can hear some rats squeaking from a
    distance and dripping water from the ceiling. There doesn''t seem to be anyone
    guarding the cell. Looks like I''m completely alone...


    What should I do?


    1.
    Get up and move towards the cell door.

    2. Get up and look through the cell
    window.'
