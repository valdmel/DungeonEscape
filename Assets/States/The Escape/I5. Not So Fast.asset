  storyText: "All of sudden, I hear that terrifying growl. I turn around and, coming
    towards me in a furious way, there it is! That creature again! It might have
    heard the sound of the gate opening. It is holding its bloodied huge meat cleaver,
    ready to cut me down to pieces! \nTo my left, there is another lever that seems
    to control the gate right above me. At my back, my freedom. I have to choose
    wisely!\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n1. Kick the lever!\n2. Run!"
