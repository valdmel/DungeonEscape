  storyText: 'I sit on the old chair to recompose myself... Thinking about all of
    those bodies and that cannibal creature makes me shiver. "I could''ve been the
    next victim hadn''t I act quickly" - I thought.

    Just as I sit, I hear a
    clicking sound and all of sudden, the wall next to me moves. I get up and, standing
    right in front of me, a secret passage leading to somewhere else in this dungeon.

    

    What
    should I do?

    

    1. Enter the passage.'
