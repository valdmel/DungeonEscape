  storyText: 'There doesn''t seem to be a living soul in this floor too. I can still
    hear these strange growls coming from somewhere in this place as I follow this
    blood trail down the corridor...

    Now I have found myself in a mid-sized
    room with three  paths: one to my right, one to my left and one in front of me.
    The blood trail goes into the room behind the door on the right, and is possible
    to hear a furnace-like sound.

    In front of me, there is a blocked passage.


    What
    should I do?


    1. Open the right door.

    2. Open the left door.'
