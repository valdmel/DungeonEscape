  storyText: 'I decided move foward into the dark corridor without a light source.
    My own footsteps is all I can hear in this place...

    I can''t really tell
    whether there is something useful inside any of these cells or not, or whether
    someone else is alive. As I walk down the corridor, I notice a staircase right
    in front of me. I can hear a strange noise coming from downstairs...


    What
    should I do?


    1. Go downstairs.'
