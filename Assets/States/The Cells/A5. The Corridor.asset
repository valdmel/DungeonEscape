  storyText: 'The cell door was unlocked the whole time. "Freedom... for now" - I
    thought to myself - "But why is the cell unlocked?".

    Right in front of me,
    I see a large corridor with some closed cell doors. Though slightly visible due
    to the torches on the wall, I can''t clearly see much of the path ahead of me.
    A light source might come in handy.


    What should I do?


    1. Pick up
    a torch and move foward.

    2. Move foward without a light source.'
